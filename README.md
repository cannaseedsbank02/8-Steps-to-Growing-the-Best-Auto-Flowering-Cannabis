Yes, sun, heat and long days are the ideal conditions for auto flowering cannabis plants to bring out the best in themselves.

The Key: Optimizing Resources from the Beginning

If you are going to grow auto flowering auto flowering cannabis seeds, you must have a clear idea in your head. Their life cycle is so short—two months from culture, that it is fundamental to optimize resources from the beginning.

Step 1. Choose the Seed that Best Suits your Tastes

The range of Blueberry auto flowering seeds with auto flowering is more and more extensive. Even if at first they had certain deficiencies compared to feminized seeds, today the automatic varieties have nothing to envy to their cousin sisters.

Step 2. Germination

Auto flowering cannabis seeds do not require a different type of germination than other feminized seeds. You can choose the method that suits you best, but we recommend our Dinafem method for outdoor sprouting. 

Step 3. Prepare the Earth

Auto flowering plants require an aerated substrate to allow them to take full advantage of the resources, to develop their roots well and to speed up all their metabolic processes. How to aerate the earth? Well, it's very simple: you need 10 liters of substrate, which is composed of 1/3 of coconut fiber and 2/3 of peat or already prepared substrate. If your crop is for therapeutic purposes, try using an organic growing method.

Step 4. Pot

The smallest size of pot you will use should be 7-15 liters if you want to get the biggest plants possible, and it is important that you know that this is going to be the definitive. It is not recommended that auto flowering plants be transplanted in the middle of their life cycle to avoid stress.

Step 5. Watering

Auto flowering plants have better water deficiencies than feminized ones. That is why it is advisable to water them in small quantity—never let the plant soak—but very frequently to favor the oxygenation. 

Step 6. Washing the Roots

If you have used a type of fertilizer, chemical or organic, you must "clean" the heads to prevent their taste is altered by these substances. It's very easy to do. Two weeks before harvest—which will have peaked between 70 and 80 days after sowing, depending on the variety—you  must thoroughly water the plant with plenty of clean water , which may be tap, or treated reverse osmosis to drive all the fertilizer remaining in the substrate.

Step 7. Harvest

70 to 80 days after sowing, you can finally harvest your heads. First, we recommend that you do not water the plant five days before the harvest to make the soil dry. You will realize that the heads are ready because the color of the trichomes of the resin will start to change from white to amber and, above all, because the plant is yellow. 

Step 8. Manicure

Then, you will have to make the manicure of cutting the small leaves of the heads so that they have a better appearance and to make that they develop complex aromas during the drying and to avoid that our dear grass feels the vegetable.
